# Neural_Network
Neural networks for classification and regression from scratch with Python

The last is dedicated to the definition of the class "NeuralNet" for training neural networks.

- The file "Neural_network2" contains the main algorithm applied to two dataset (for classification and regression). Results are also compared with the Keras Neural Network library. For a complete view --> https://nbviewer.org/github/SamuComqi92/Neural_Network/blob/main/Neural_network2.ipynb
- The file "Neural_network2_adam" contains an updated version of the main algorithm where it is possible to choose a different Gradient Descent algorithm ("batch", "adam") and to add a momentum to the Gradient Descent.
